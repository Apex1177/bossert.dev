                <p> Hi, I currently play top lane for Mizzou's varsity League of Legends team. 
                    I have peaked GM, which is the top 1000 players out of the 15 million on the server. 
                    I have played for various amature organizations and have personally won over $2,000 in cash prizes.
                    I also play Overwatch, peaked rank 1, and placed 2nd at the MOSEF state tournament. 
                </p>
