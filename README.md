This is my website project to showcase my projects and link people to my github and other socials.
I learned a lot about JS, html, and CSS through this project.
I plan to host download links to some of my other projects here in the future when they are ready. 
I asked for permission to fork Jerrinth's website https://github.com/zugebot for most of the assets used in this website, it is very much appreciated.
