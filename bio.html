                <p> Hi, my name is Henry, I am a CS major at Mizzou and I have been coding since 2021. 
                    I am most proficient with Python and I am currently learning C in university. 
                    I also have limited experience with Java, C++, HTML, CSS, JS, and Bash. I also know how to work with Git, Github, and Linux.
                    Check out some of my projects on this website.
